Business Understanding
    1. Explanation of features
    2. Project Goal
    2. Hypothesis (Null and Alternate)
    3. Analytical questions
Data Understanding
    1. Importation
    2. Load Dataset
    3. EDA
        1. Explore data (info, duplicated, null values, describe)
        2. Univariate, Bi-variate, Multi-variate Analysis
    4. Answer Analytical questions with visulizations
    5. Test hypothesis
    6. Give your insights
Data Preparation
    1. Split data set into X, y
    2. Split data set into training and evaluation
    3. Feature Engineering (Creating New Features (binning & bucketing), Handling Missing Data, Encoding, 
        Normalization & scaling)
      a. Create a pipeline to preprocess the data
        1. Separate inpute features into numeric and categorical for different pipelines
        2. Handle missing values using imputation Techniques
        3. Scaling or normalize numeric features
        4. Encode categorical features
        5. Transformations for skewed data (log, power, custom, etc)
        6. Balance Data set (depending on what you see)
    4. Encode label/target
Modeling 
    1. Fit data to the pipeline and train Model
        1.Train Model 1 - Distance based model
        2.Train Model 2 - Gradient Descent model
        3.Train Model 3 - Tree based model
Evaluation
    1. Advance model evaluation
    2. Visualizing model performance
    3. Hyperparameter Tuning and Retraining
    3. Selecting the apropriate model
    4. Persit Model
