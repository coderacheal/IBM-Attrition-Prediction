## `Phase 1 - Business Understanding`

In this phase, you work closely with stakeholders and domain experts to gain a clear understanding of the business problem you're trying to solve `(This should be done with members of your team)`. In business understanding, you develop the goals of the project, identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure success, and gather domain-specific context. Developing a hypothesis can occur at this stage as you formulate initial ideas about the relationship between variables, potential patterns, and expected outcomes.

For example, if you're working on a churn prediction problem for a subscription service, your hypothesis might be: "Customers who have not engaged with the service in the past 30 days are more likely to churn."


**Tasks in this Phase**

   1. Develop your `Null Hypothesis`
   2. Develop your `Alternate Hypothesis`
   3. Ask analytical questions


# Statistical Analysis with Python - Hypothesis Testing

Statistical hypothesis testing is a fundamental concept in statistics and data analysis. It is used to make inferences about populations based on sample data. In Python, you can perform hypothesis testing using libraries like SciPy and Statsmodels. 

- **One-sample test**: Uses only one variable/columns
- **Two-sample test**: Uses 2 variables/columns

## **Hypothesis Testing Process:**

1. **Formulate Hypotheses:**
   - Null Hypothesis (H0): This is the default assumption. It states that there is no effect or no difference.
   - Alternative Hypothesis (H1 or Ha): This is what you are trying to test or prove.

2. **Choose a Significance Level (α):**
   - The significance level (α) represents the probability of making a Type I error, i.e., rejecting the null hypothesis when it's true. Common values include 0.05 or 0.01.

3. **Collect and Analyze Data:**
   - Gather data and perform the necessary calculations and tests.

4. **Perform the Hypothesis Test:**
   - Calculate a test statistic (e.g., t-statistic, z-statistic) based on the data and the chosen test.
   - Compare the test statistic to a critical value or calculate a p-value.

5. **Make a Decision:**
   - If the p-value is less than α, reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.
   - If the p-value is greater than or equal to α, fail to reject the null hypothesis.

6. **Draw Conclusions:**
   - Based on your decision, draw conclusions about the population from which the sample was drawn.


## **Common Hypothesis Tests in Python:**


### 1. **t-Test (for comparing means):**

- **Purpose:** The t-test is used to compare the means of two groups and determine if there is a statistically significant difference between them.

- **Types:**
  - **One-Sample t-Test:** Used to compare the mean of a sample to a known population mean.
  - **Independent Two-Sample t-Test:** Used to compare the means of two independent groups (e.g., treatment vs. control group).
  - **Paired t-Test:** Used to compare the means of two related groups (e.g., before and after measurements on the same subjects).

- **Assumptions:**
  - Data is approximately normally distributed.
  - Homogeneity of variances (variance of groups is roughly equal).
  - Random and independent samples.

- **Hypotheses:**
  - Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference between the means.
  - Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): There is a significant difference between the means.


### 2. **Chi-Square Test (for categorical data):**

- **Purpose:** The chi-square test is used to determine if there is an association between two categorical variables. It assesses whether observed data differs significantly from expected data.

- **Types:**
  - **Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test:** Used to compare observed categorical data to expected data in a single categorical variable.
  - **Chi-Square Test of Independence:** Used to test the independence of two categorical variables in a contingency table.

- **Assumptions:** The chi-square test assumes that the observations are independent.

- **Hypotheses:**
  - Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no association between the variables (independence).
  - Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): There is an association between the variables.

### 3. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):**

- **Purpose:** ANOVA is used to compare means of three or more groups to determine if at least one group is statistically different from the others. It can also identify which group(s) are different if the overall test is significant.

- **Types:**
  - **One-Way ANOVA:** Compares means of three or more independent groups.
  - **Two-Way ANOVA:** Extends one-way ANOVA to analyze the effects of two independent categorical variables.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Data is approximately normally distributed.
  - Homogeneity of variances (variance is roughly equal across groups).
  - Independence of observations.

- **Hypotheses:**
  - Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference among group means.
  - Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): At least one group mean is significantly different from the others.
